# Final Project Outline

## One sentence summary: 
Student homelessness is on the rise and Utah’s school funding strategy keeps schools from helping.

## Outline:
### Introduction
Utah reduced its chronic homeless population by 90% in 2015, gaining notoriety across the nation for its revolutionary methods. Or did it? Utah had lower unsheltered rates, but higher rates of doubled up housing. Student homelessness is on the rise -- across the US and in Utah. 

### Body
About student homelessness in Utah: How it’s measured, where most of the students are spending the night, main causes of homelessness in Utah

What can schools do to help?: Things other schools are doing across the US, Success stories, Resources schools can tap in on.

Utah’s schools are stretched so thin that they can’t fully participate in these kinds of programs: An explanation of the Utah school funding strategy, Growth of school fund (graph)

Utah’s per pupil rate is lowest in the country: Compare to other states where examples were, show how this affects student programs and the McKinney-Vento liaison availability
	
### Call to action
What we can do: Contact reps to approve more school funding, constitutional amendment to use income tax for school funds, not just interest

Support education advocacy groups and children’s advocacy groups: Who you can call, link to who’s your rep contact website, links to local charities that are helping with this

## Data:
I anticipate using the data from the below links to create charts that show the homeless situation in Utah, particularly for children under 18 years old (achievement, enrollment, total numbers, etc). The data will be used to assist in informing Utahns about the state of homelessness and education in their state, and what they can do to help.

## Method and Medium:
I will complete this project as a journal style story map on Esri. For the presentation, I will focus my attention to the most pressing points, student homelessness in Utah and school funding lapses, with a push towards what Utahns can do to help. I will use the presentation as practice for making this pitch to the citizens of Utah when I move there.
