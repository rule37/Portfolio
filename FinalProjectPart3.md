# Final Project, Part 3: The Story Map

This week, we produced our final product for the course, a data story made public for the world to see. The final product is <a href="https://arcg.is/1nyrS8">here</a>. This page covers the process up to this point and some information about the creation of my final deliverable.

##Final Data Story
My final data story is about student homelessness in Utah. It includes information about homelessness in Utah, student homelessness, ways that other school districts are helping their students, and ways that the general public can support these efforts. My one sentence summary is "Homeless students in Utah are being left behind and schools need more resources to help."

### Part 1: The idea
Originally, my one sentence summary was "Student homelessness is on the rise and Utahâ€™s school funding strategy keeps schools from helping." This summary determined the direction of my story. 

I split the story then into four different sections: the introduction/hook, student homelessness in Utah, what other schools are doing to help, and the call to action.
<UL>
<LI>Introduction: 
I wanted the introduction to be a bait and switch sort of thing. I knew that my audience would probably know about all of Utah's praise for having piloted a Housing First model and reducing chronic homelessness, but I want to bring to their attention that those shrinking numbers weren't happening across the state. In fact, student homelessness is on the rise in Utah. So I wanted my hook to acknowledge the success that Utah was claiming, but also bring attention to the fact that it wasn't a system that was working for everyone. My introduction then included information about Utah's successes, and then immediately some sort of message that homelessness was rising in Utah in the next section. </LI>

<LI>Student homelessness in Utah:
For my second section, I wanted to lay out some facts about student homelessness in Utah so that the audience understood the gravity of the situation and made the first second feel real, rather than just quotes taken out of context. So I created pages based on the number of homeless students and their achievement (so why homelessness matters for students). I wanted this section to be as concise and engaging as possible while answering some of the question that my audience might have, such as how homeless people are counted and what affects homeless students' achievement.</LI>

<LI>What other schools are doing: 
Next, I wanted to give my audience some hope so they didn't click off the page feeling like there was nothing that could be done. I therefore wanted to point to examples where schools and services could really help families and use the students' connection to their schools as a point of contact for homeless services. So I grabbed a couple of examples from other school districts to show what could happen in Utah. </LI>

<LI>The call to action:
Next, it made sense to bring to light the reasons why Utah hasn't been able to make the same kinds of collaborations that school districts in other states have been able to. By pointing out Utah's funding shortfalls, I can point towards the call to action: to get more funding in schools. After deeper research, I found that a more solid argument to connect low per student spending to homeless students' needs were in student teacher ratios. Through the connection between low funding, access to teachers, and more student-teacher relationships, I was able to make a solid plea for why Utah needed more funding in schools and community services needed more funding to operate in tandem with schools.</LI>

I really wanted to use data to back up my points and do a lot of the story telling for me. I knew that adding graphs and charts would need to be explained, but I hoped that open source data, that anyone could get access to, would 

### Part 3: Creating the data story
Personas:
For this data story, I created two personas: David and Jane

David is between white man between 23 and 30, does not have a college degree, kids, or lots of expendible income. He's part of the millenial generation, and spends a lot of time online, on social media, and working. His time is limited and his commitment to any one cause is based on his desire to spread interesting and important information. He's not civically active; he will vote in general elections but not always in primaries. Even still, he cares about the future, including about child welfare, climate change, and economic stability. He is an atheist but he cares deeply about fairness between people and believes that everyone should have the same jumping off point from which someone can grow based on merit. 

Because David is short on time, he does not want to spend more than five to ten minutes on learning something new. I therefore made my narrative concise, especially during the first sections of the story map. By making the hook concise and impactful, I can keep David engaged enough to want to get into the meat of the story and understand
