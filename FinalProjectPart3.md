# Final Project, Part 3: The Story Map

This week, we produced our final product for the course, a data story made public for the world to see. The final product is <a href="https://arcg.is/1nyrS8">here</a>. This page covers the process up to this point and some information about the creation of my final deliverable.

## Final Data Story
My final data story is about student homelessness in Utah. It includes information about homelessness in Utah, student homelessness, ways that other school districts are helping their students, and ways that the general public can support these efforts. My one sentence summary is "Homeless students in Utah are being left behind and schools need more resources to help."

### Part 1: The idea
Originally, my one sentence summary was "Student homelessness is on the rise and Utahâ€™s school funding strategy keeps schools from helping." This summary determined the direction of my story. 

I split the story then into four different sections: the introduction/hook, student homelessness in Utah, what other schools are doing to help, and the call to action.
<UL>
<LI>Introduction: 
I wanted the introduction to be a bait and switch sort of thing. I knew that my audience would probably know about all of Utah's praise for having piloted a Housing First model and reducing chronic homelessness, but I want to bring to their attention that those shrinking numbers weren't happening across the state. In fact, student homelessness is on the rise in Utah. So I wanted my hook to acknowledge the success that Utah was claiming, but also bring attention to the fact that it wasn't a system that was working for everyone. My introduction then included information about Utah's successes, and then immediately some sort of message that homelessness was rising in Utah in the next section. </LI>

<LI>Student homelessness in Utah:
For my second section, I wanted to lay out some facts about student homelessness in Utah so that the audience understood the gravity of the situation and made the first second feel real, rather than just quotes taken out of context. So I created pages based on the number of homeless students and their achievement (so why homelessness matters for students). I wanted this section to be as concise and engaging as possible while answering some of the question that my audience might have, such as how homeless people are counted and what affects homeless students' achievement.</LI>

<LI>What other schools are doing: 
Next, I wanted to give my audience some hope so they didn't click off the page feeling like there was nothing that could be done. I therefore wanted to point to examples where schools and services could really help families and use the students' connection to their schools as a point of contact for homeless services. So I grabbed a couple of examples from other school districts to show what could happen in Utah. </LI>

<LI>The call to action:
Next, it made sense to bring to light the reasons why Utah hasn't been able to make the same kinds of collaborations that school districts in other states have been able to. By pointing out Utah's funding shortfalls, I can point towards the call to action: to get more funding in schools. After deeper research, I found that a more solid argument to connect low per student spending to homeless students' needs were in student teacher ratios. Through the connection between low funding, access to teachers, and more student-teacher relationships, I was able to make a solid plea for why Utah needed more funding in schools and community services needed more funding to operate in tandem with schools.</LI>
</UL>

I really wanted to use data to back up my points and do a lot of the story telling for me. I knew that adding graphs and charts would need to be explained, but I hoped that open source data, that anyone could get access to, would allow others to track my work and ensure transparency. I therefore used publically accessible data from the United States Department of Education through the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/">National Center for Education Statistics</a> and <a href="https://eddataexpress.ed.gov/state-tables-main.cfm">ED Data Express</a>. I wanted to use the data particularly for showing the number of homeless students in Utah, the proficiency scores for homeless students compared to the average students in Utah, and comparing Utah's per pupil funding and student teacher ratio to those in other states. 

This project is meant to be something I could use as a portfolio piece and as an entry in the library's Story Map Competition, so I decided to make this data story in an Esri story map. I completed this project as a journal style story map. For the presentation, I will focus my attention to the most pressing points, student homelessness in Utah and school funding lapses, with a push towards what Utahns can do to help. I will use the presentation as practice for making this pitch to the citizens of Utah when I move there.

### Part 2: Storyboarding

Step 1: Story arc and sketches

<img src="StoryArc.jpg"> 

I started with the story arc above. I really wanted to take my audience on a journey and I wanted to make sympathetic actors out of an otherwise naive or apathetic audience. I used that story arc to create my story board, which is below.

Step 2: Interviews and feedback

<img src="IMG_20190218_223958 (1).jpg">
For this step, I asked a few people I know from Utah to weigh in on my sketches and let me know what they think. I let them read the story board, and then asked them the following questions:
<OL>
  <LI>What is the point of this story?</LI>
  <LI>What is your takeaway?</LI>
  <LI>What did you like? What did you not like? Why?</LI>
  <LI>What is missing?</LI>
  <LI>If you were to read this as a page on a website, how long would you spend engaged with it?</LI>
  <LI>After reading this, what will you do?</LI>
</OL>

The feedback I got was great. I learned that my subjects would spend no more than 7 minutes reading the storymap, which lets me know that I need to be concise and impactful, and that my audience will likely not want something that gets too far into the weeds of the information. My research also alerted me to explaining some more of the lingo, but that the story arc was good and led into the story well. When asked about what subjects would do after reading the narrative, most responded that they would not do anything, and that a clear, quick, and easy to do call to action might urge my subject to act. Aside from that, most subjects said they would share the story on social media.

Step 3: Wireframing and mock ups

<img src="HomelessStudent.jpg">
So far I've made a few of the graphs that will eventually make it into the final project. I've discussed my narrative with my subjects and have a great deal to consider before making the final draft. Balancing the length of time people are willing to spend reading the storymap and the amount of information people might want about the subject will be difficult, but I hope that my visualizations will be sufficient to make the storymap concise and impactful.

### Part 3: Creating the data story
Personas:
For this data story, I created two personas: David and Jane

David is a white man between 23 and 30, does not have a college degree, kids, or lots of expendible income. He's part of the millenial generation, and spends a lot of time online, on social media, and working. His time is limited and his commitment to any one cause is based on his desire to spread interesting and important information. He's not civically active; he will vote in general elections but not always in primaries. Even still, he cares about the future, including about child welfare, climate change, and economic stability. He is an atheist but he cares deeply about fairness between people and believes that everyone should have the same jumping off point from which someone can grow based on merit. 

Because David is short on time, he does not want to spend more than five to ten minutes on learning something new. I therefore made my narrative concise, especially during the first sections of the story map. By making the hook concise and impactful, I can keep David engaged enough to read the longer portions later. I expect that David will want to share my story on facebook or twitter, so I want to make the story map public and make the share buttons easy to find and available throughout the presentation.

Jane is a white mother with a few kids in Utah's public school system. She is a gen-X-er and cares deeply about her community. She belongs to the Church of the Latter Day Saints and is conservative in her fiscal policies. She stays home during the day while her husband works. Even still she has an active social life, engages regularly with her neighbors, and volunteers in social and religious causes. She feels that taxes should be low and charity giving should be high, both to the church and other responsible nonprofit organizations. She believes that everyone should have a fair shot at success, but will do anything to give her children an opportunity. Jane has a little more time on her hands than David, but that time largely happens between mid-morning and around 2PM, when her children get out of school. In that time, she usually visits her elderly neighbors and takes care of the family errands. She also spends her down time on her computer, socializing on facebook, reading interesting articles, and keeping up with the news. 

Jane will likely see this data story on facebook from a friend, and be urged to donate to recommended nonprofit organizations. For this reason, I made sure my call to action included charities that could help. Due to her conservative nature, I wanted to make the story map even toned and approachable, so she might also believe that these students, who she feels should be largely helped by charity, deserve a chance at success as well. 

Esri's limitations informed many of my design decisions. I wanted the color and design to feel fairly somber, but fairly conventional with black text on a light background. I chose a theme that reflected that, allowing the background for my main stage to be a darker color. 

I spent a lot of time considering colors for the graphs and choosing things that reflected the drier colors of the desert. The exception to this was the reading and math proficiency graph; I wanted to make the colors bold enough that it would be easy to discern which lines we wanted to focus on and which were related.

Creating this story map was both really enjoyable and really difficult. I lamented that I couldn't control as many aspects of the design as I wanted, including the legend for my maps. The limited range of design decisions that I could make once I put the information online was frustrating, especially after my experience with some of the data viz tools we explored in class and my own experience in applications like ArcGIS Pro and Tableau. Other than that, I took some words of advice for creating my story map (mainly that I should write out everything I wanted to put in before I started the process on Esri's website) and used my personas and research feedback to guide many of the decisions I made.
