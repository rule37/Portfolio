## One sentence summary:

## Outline:
### Introduction

-Media: images, videos of news stories
Or did it? 
-Media: concerns about the methodologies, rising homeless rates in Utah. Graphs: time series line graph about PIT counts in Utah

Data:
	I anticipate using the data from the below links to create charts that show the homeless situation in Utah, particularly for children under 18 years old (achievement, enrollment, total numbers, etc). The data will be used to assist in informing Utahns about the state of homelessness and education in their state, and what they can do to help (more details in the outline above).

Method and Medium:
	I will complete this project as a journal style story map on Esri. For the presentation, I will focus my attention to the most pressing points, student homelessness in Utah and school funding lapses, with a push towards what Utahns can do to help. I will use the presentation as practice for making this pitch to the citizens of Utah when I move there.
