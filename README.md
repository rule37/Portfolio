# Portfolio
This is my portfolio from my course at Carnegie Mellon University, Telling Stories with Data.

## About Me:
I am a MSPPM graduate from Hawaii who has found a passion for data analysis and coding. I am interested in housing security, access and improved healthcare, and education. When I graduate, I hope to do data analysis for the management team of an organization.  I want to make data beautiful and interesting, easy to understand and action-invoking. I am excited to show you the various tools I used to create visuals, and the process I used to get them.
