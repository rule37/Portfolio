# Portfolio
This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data.

About Me:
I am a MSPPM student from Hawaii who has found a passion for data analysis and coding. I am interested in housing security, homelessness, and affordable housing options. When I graduate, I hope to do data analysis for the management team of an organization. 

What I Hope to Learn:
I hope to learn about how to make data visually compelling and meaningful for a target audience. I want to make data beautiful and interesting, easy to understand and action-invoking. I am excited to learn various tools to create visuals, and get a portfolio together to share my work with any interested parties.
